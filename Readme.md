3D chess game developed as a demo of the work and research I've done around the babylon.js game engine over the last few years.

The stack is node for the backend, along with fastify & fastify websockets to handle api request, hyperapp for the front-end, and rxjs for async event handling.

The vision of the project is to allow chess loving individuals to play and watch matches, while chatting and sharing intersting media. 

The project is still in development with plans to add features as I see fit.
