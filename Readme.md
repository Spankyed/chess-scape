# Chess-Scape

3D chess game developed as a demo of the work and research I've done around the BabylonJS game engine over the last few years.

The vision of the project is to allow chess loving individuals to play and watch matches, while chatting and sharing interesting media. 

The project is still in development with plans to add features as I see fit.

Support for Internet Explorer 9 and up.
